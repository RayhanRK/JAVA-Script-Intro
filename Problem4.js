// Practice Problem 4

// What will be the result of the following codes:

// 1) const a = isNaN(â€˜11');

// 2) const a = isNaN(2-10);

// Explain your answers.

Ans: both option 1 and 2 will be false because - in No.1 string value 11  will converted to valid number by javascript
and in  No.2 result is -8 which is also a valid number. hence NaN or Not a number stetement is false in both case.
